		And on his neck a snake, which is hung like a garland,<br>
		And the Damaru drum that emits the sound “Damat Damat Damat Damat”,<br>
		Lord Shiva did the auspicious dance of Tandava. May he give prosperity to all of us.||1||<br><br>

		I have a deep interest in Shiva<br>
		Whose head is glorified by the rows of moving waves of the celestial Ganga river,<br>
		Which stir in the deep well of his hair in tangled locks.<br>
		Who has the brilliant fire burning on the surface of his forehead,<br>
		And who has the crescent moon as a jewel on his head.||2||<br><br>

		May my mind seek happiness in Lord Shiva,<br>
		In whose mind all the living beings of the glorious universe exist,<br>
		Who is the companion of Parvati (daughter of the mountain king),<br>
		Who controls unsurpassed adversity with his compassionate gaze, Which is all-pervading<br>
		And who wears the Heavens as his raiment.||3||<br><br>

		May I find wonderful pleasure in Lord Shiva, who is the advocate of all life,<br>
		With his creeping snake with its reddish brown hood and the shine of its gem on it<br>
		Spreading variegated colors on the beautiful faces of the Goddesses of the Directions,<br>
		Which is covered by a shimmering shawl made from the skin of a huge, inebriated elephant.||4||<br><br>

		May Lord Shiva give us prosperity,<br>
		Who has the Moon as a crown,<br>
		Whose hair is bound by the red snake-garland,<br>
		Whose footrest is darkened by the flow of dust from flowers<br>
		Which fall from the heads of all the gods – Indra, Vishnu and others.||5||<br><br>

		May Lord Shiva give us prosperity,<br>
		Who has the Moon as a crown,<br>
		Whose hair is bound by the red snake-garland,<br>
		Whose footrest is darkened by the flow of dust from flowers<br>
		Which fall from the heads of all the gods – Indra, Vishnu and others.||6||<br><br>

		May we obtain the riches of the Siddhis from the tangled strands Shiva’s hair,<br>
		Who devoured the God of Love with the sparks of the fire that burns on his forehead,<br>
		Which is revered by all the heavenly leaders,<br>
		Which is beautiful with a crescent moon.||7||<br><br>

		My interest is in Lord Shiva, who has three eyes,<br>
		Who offered the powerful God of Love to fire.<br>
		The terrible surface of his forehead burns with the sound “Dhagad, Dhagad …”<br>
		He is the only artist expert in tracing decorative lines<br>
		on the tips of the breasts of Parvati, the daughter of the mountain king.||8||<br><br>

		May Lord Shiva give us prosperity,<br>
		The one who bears the weight of this universe,<br>
		Who is enchanting with the moon,<br>
		Who has the celestial river Ganga<br><br>
		Whose neck is dark as midnight on a new moon night, covered in layers of clouds.||9||<br><br>

		I pray to Lord Shiva, whose neck is bound with the brightness of the temples<br>
		hanging with the glory of fully bloomed blue lotus flowers,<br>
		Which look like the blackness of the universe.<br>
		Who is the slayer of Manmatha, who destroyed the Tripura,<br>
		Who destroyed the bonds of worldly life, who destroyed the sacrifice,<br>
		Who destroyed the demon Andhaka, who is the destroyer of the elephants,<br>
		And who has overwhelmed the God of death, Yama.||10||<br><br>

		I pray to Lord Siva, who has bees flying all around because of the sweet<br>
		Scent of honey coming from the beautiful bouquet of auspicious Kadamba flowers,<br>
		Who is the slayer of Manmatha, who destroyed the Tripura,<br>
		Who destroyed the bonds of worldly life, who destroyed the sacrifice,<br>
		Who destroyed the demon Andhaka, who is the destroyer of the elephants,<br>
		And who has overwhelmed the God of death, Yama.||11||<br><br>

		Shiva, whose dance of Tandava is in tune with the series of loud<br>
		sounds of drum making the sound “Dhimid Dhimid”,<br>
		Who has fire on his great forehead, the fire that is spreading out because of the<br>
		breath of the snake, wandering in whirling motions in the glorious sky.||12||<br><br>

		When will I be able to worship Lord Sadashiva, the eternally auspicious God,<br>
		With equanimous vision towards people or emperors,<br><br>
		Towards a blade of grass and a lotus, towards friends and enemies,<br>
		Towards the most precious gem and a lump of dirt,<br>
		Toward a snake or a garland and towards the varied forms of the world?||13||<br><br>

		When I can be happy, living in a cave near the celestial river Ganga,<br>
		Bringing my hands clasped on my head all the time,<br>
		With my impure thoughts washed away, uttering the mantra of Shiva,<br>
		Devoted to the God with a glorious forehead and with vibrant eyes?||14||<br><br>

		Anyone who reads, remembers and recites this stotra as stated here<br>
		Is purified forever and obtains devotion in the great Guru Shiva.<br>
		For this devotion, there is no other way or refuge.<br>
		Just the mere thought of Shiva removes the delusion.||15||<br><br>
